<p>When you come to the “Politecnico” for a lecture, you have to find a classroom, but the “Cittadella Politecnica” is too huge, full of different classrooms and laboratories, and you start to turn around it,  wishing to find your target. Don't worry, come on! We have a solution! PoliRoute!</p>

<p>PoliRoute is a smart system aimed to guide the user in the “Cittadella”, driving him to his destination. All this is done using an interactive system, composed of arrows made with LEDs and touchscreen on the starting point. In all the area of “Cittadella”, were be disposed some touchscreen, which are the starting point. The screen indicates where the user is on a map and he can select what is the destination, choosing one of the classes and laboratories. The system will calculate the minimum walk and  indicates which will be the color of his indications. It also indicates the distance , in order to understand how far is the destination .The system will give him a bracelet and the screen gives him the first indication to follow. On the way, he will find some intelligent LED arrows, which feel the presence of the user and lights on the arrow in the  direction  which he has to follow. If you  miss some indication, the system recalculates the minimum walk to arrive at destination and a LED arrow will show you the direction to follow. When the user arrives to the destination, the system understand it and it's ready to have one more user!</p>

<p>The PoliRoute touchscreen are placed in the most efficient way all around  the “Cittadella Politecnica”, distributed fairly in different areas. In this way the user can starts from every point, choosing the first screen which he see!   The system will be able to manage many users at the same time, using more arrows with different colors at every corner, each for any user.  </p>

<p>PoliRoute will make easy to find all that you want in the “Cittadella Politecnica”, for professors, students and external  guest, with a simple system, simple to follow and optimized  to reduce the time to go from every point to another one.</p>
